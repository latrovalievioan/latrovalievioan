### Glad to see you here!  
🧑‍💻 I'm a 27-year-old web developer who enjoys creating things for the web.

🔬 I love to learn and experiment. Despite my preference for the front end, I enjoy solving algorithmic tasks in my spare time. I'm also one of those oddballs who use VIM.

🎻 When I'm not at the computer, you can find me playing jazz on my violin.

🎙️ I am currently employed as a frontend developer at LucidLink.
